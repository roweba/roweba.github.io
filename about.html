     <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
    <div id="pleft"> The first exposure I had to coding was in Grade 10 when I was 15. I had just dropped a class and needed a new elective,
      but the only available one was an upper level programming class. I decided to try it out, as I had never coded before
      and figured it would be interesting to try out (I also had no choice). I ended up struggling with the class and
      got the lowest grade I have ever received in a high school class. After that, I was put off coding for a while, until
      I was required to take another computer science course in first year University. I took a lot of general courses in my first year, and realized
      that out of all of them I actually enjoyed my coding classes the most. I decided to change my major, and never looked
      back!
