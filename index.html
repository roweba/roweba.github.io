    <p>Hey! This is a website I built from scratch as a way to practice my HTML/CSS skills. It also serves
      as a portfolio for my work. It is best viewed on desktop as I have not optimized a mobile version
      yet. This website is hosted on <a href="http://github.com/roweba" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
    <p>I am currently a second year Computer Science student at the University of Victoria, located in Victoria, BC. You can
       find out more about me on the <a href="about.html">About</a> page, and my experience on the <a href="resume.html">Resume</a>
       page. Right now, I am looking for a co-op for the Summer of 2017. Through obtaining a co-op I hope to be able to apply
       and expand my programming skillset. I also hope to expand my professional network, and gain new experiences in the
       working world.
    </p>
    <p>I am interested in full-stack development. In my classes, I have learned various elements of computer
      science theory, software engineering principles, and computer hardware. I believe programming is such a fundamental
      skill to have, which is not emphasized enough in the world today. I have always loved creating new things, and the way
      programming allows me to do that is one of the main reasons I chose my major.
    </p>
    <p>Aside from programming, I am interested in music, art, history, literature, and world cultures.</p>
