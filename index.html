    <p>Welcome to my page!
      This website is hosted on <a href="http://github.com/roweba" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
    </p>
    <p>My name is Rowena Zhu and I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of Victoria.
    I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science - Software Engineering option with Co-op (a mouthful).
  I have previous experience working with the BC provincial government, focusing on networks. This was an amazing
  opportunity, as it really expanded my horizons. I was exposed to office culture, and learned a great deal about
  computer networking. For my next co-op I am looking to focus on development.</p>
<p>I believe programming is such a fundamental skill to have, which is not emphasized enough in the world today.
This has prompted me to share my knowlege and love of technology with others. I currently work as a Youth Stem Instructor
at Science Venture, and teach children code. I have also volunteered with Ladies Learning Code, and UVic computer science clubs.</p>
    <p>I am interested software development and computer networking. In my classes, I have learned various elements of programming
      skills, algorithms/data structures, software engineering principles, computer networking, and computer hardware. I have always loved creating new things, and the way
      programming allows me to do that is one of the main reasons I chose my major.
    </p>
    <p>Aside from programming, I am interested in music, art, history, literature, and world cultures.</p>
