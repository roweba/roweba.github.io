     <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
    <div id="pleft"> When I was younger, my household only had a single desktop computer which my brother
      and I would always argue who got to use. From a young age, I was always fascinated with how a computer could
      allow me to do so much, such as play games and communicate with others across the world. My first experience with coding
      was when I was 12 and I edited the HTML on my Tumblr page to add features. In early high school, I was unexpectedly placed in an
      upper-level Java class due to complications with my timetable. I ended up struggling with the class and believed programming wasn't for me. I went
      into first-year university planning to do a degree in engineering, and took a lot of general courses. One of these was a programming course. When I would
      write code for this class, I realized I actually was having fun doing homework(amazing concept!). I changed my major, and never looked back.
      <br><br>I have always wanted to do something that allows me to explore my
      creativity, but also help the world. Computer science blurs the lines between
      technology and art, and is the perfect synthesis of everything I am passionate about.
